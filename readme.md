## Triggers

- [x] Account balance

- [ ] Amount of budget used
- [ ] Age of Money

## Actions

- [x] Add Transaction
- [x] Update transaction

## TODO:

- [] Set up the test endpoints properly
- [] Implement a 'preferred budget' setting (needs a DB for user preference)
- [] Consider a stored balance log to replace on-the-fly logs (which can change retroactively). Needs to be somewhat intelligent, so as to not trigger every time a matching item is added to the log, like "trigger once, then wait until it no longer matches those criteria"
